# Spelletjes_Website
This is my first ever independent project, I made it after following some beginner tutorials on javaScript, HTML, CSS and PHP, but there is still a LOT to learn. 
As I often forget things I only see once, I tried to implement some of my learnings in this project to make it stick for longer. Of course I understand this is a very beginner-level project.
## The website itself
This website is designed to let you play some games, it's in dutch because I speak dutch, You can play Tetris, which I dit not make myself, and you can play hangman and a sudoku, which I did design myself (with some helf from the internet)
